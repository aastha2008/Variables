# Variables are containers, hold a value
# Data Types / Variable Types:
# String (str): combination of. charecters (letters, numbers, or symbols) - must use quotation marks
# Integer (int) : whole numbers
# Character (char) : single letter, number, or symbol
# Float : numbers with decimals
# Boolean (bool):  True / False

# Why do we need data types
# computers are the smartest dumb things in the world
# 2 + 2 = ?? what do you want the computer to do.

# formula:
# variableName = value
# Rules fpr variable names:
# 1. always start with a letter
# 2. can only contain numbers and letters
# 3. if more that one word is used, use camelCase (first word is lowercase and every word after that is uppercase)

firstName = "Aastha" #String type

## FirstName. (ok, but use lower f)
## 1stname. (bad)
## name1 (ok)

favoriteBook = "Bedtime Stories" #string
favNumber = 3 #Integer
isHungry = True #Boolean
favChar = 'l' #Char
pi = 3.14159 #Float
